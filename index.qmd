# Welcome {.unnumbered}

This is a comprehensive, hands-on curriculum for learning empirical macroeconometrics---from foundational panel data methods through Bayesian VARs and structural DSGE estimation.

## Who This Is For

This curriculum is designed for:

- **PhD students** in economics who want deep understanding of the methods they use
- **Applied researchers** who want to go beyond "running the code" to understanding *why* methods work
- **Policy economists** at central banks and research institutions

## Philosophy

Each module follows a consistent structure:

1. **Theory Block**: Mathematical foundations, key theorems, identification assumptions
2. **Monte Carlo Lab**: Simulate known DGPs → estimate → verify properties (coverage, power, bias)
3. **Applied Example**: Apply methods to real macroeconomic data
4. **Diagnostics Checklist**: What to check, what can go wrong, red flags

The goal is not just to *use* these methods, but to *understand* them deeply enough to defend your choices to a skeptical audience.

## Curriculum Overview

| Phase | Topic | Modules | Language |
|-------|-------|---------|----------|
| 1 | Foundations | Panel Econometrics, Identification | R |
| 2 | Dynamic Methods | Local Projections, VAR/SVAR | R |
| 3 | Treatment Effects | Staggered DiD, Synthetic Control | R |
| 4 | Bayesian Econometrics | Foundations, BVAR, Panel Methods | Python |
| 5 | Structural Macro | DSGE Foundations, Estimation | MATLAB/Python |
| 6 | Causal ML | Regularization, Causal Forests | Python |

## Motivation

Modern empirical macroeconomics requires fluency in a wide range of methods. A single research project might require:

- **Panel regressions** to establish baseline correlations across countries
- **Local projections** to trace dynamic responses to shocks
- **Staggered difference-in-differences** to handle heterogeneous treatment timing
- **Vector autoregressions** to characterize transmission mechanisms
- **Bayesian methods** for shrinkage and structural identification
- **Machine learning** to uncover heterogeneous effects

Rather than treating these as black boxes, this curriculum develops the intuition needed to choose, implement, and defend each method.

## Getting Started

Start with [Module 1: Panel Data Econometrics](chapters/01_panel_econometrics.qmd) and work through sequentially. Each module builds on previous concepts.

## Reproducibility

Most examples use publicly available macroeconomic data (Penn World Table, IMF IFS, World Bank WDI). Code is fully reproducible---clone the repository and render locally.

## Technical Requirements

- **R** (≥4.0) with packages: `fixest`, `lmtest`, `sandwich`, `ggplot2`, `dplyr`
- **Python** (≥3.9) with packages: `numpy`, `pandas`, `statsmodels`, `pymc`, `arviz`
- **MATLAB** (optional) for DSGE modules, or use Dynare with Octave
- **Quarto** (≥1.3) for rendering
